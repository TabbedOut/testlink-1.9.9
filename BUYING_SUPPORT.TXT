Buying TestLink Support

TestLink is a complicated piece of software, and has always been released 
under an Open Source license, and this will continue into the far future.

It has cost thousands of hours to develop, test and support TestLink. 
If you find TestLink valuable, we would appreciate if you would consider 
buying a support agreement.

Disclaimer: 
There are no SLAs on the support agreements. 
You're buying the privilege of having your questions looked at first in order of support level. 
You're doing this, because you find TestLink a valuable tool!
