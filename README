1. Introduction
===============================================================

TestLink is a web based test management and test execution system.
It enables quality assurance teams to create and manage their test 
cases as well as to organize them into test plans. These test plans 
allow team members to execute test cases and track test results 
dynamically.

TestLink is a GPL licensed open source project. All of the source code 
behind TestLink is freely available for download via SourceForge 
at http://www.sourceforge.net If you are interested in contributing 
to the TestLink effort feel free to contact us.
There is no hidden fee - 100% free for using!

In an ideal world, testing would be a pretty straightforward process.
A test team takes the product requirements, writes a test specification document,
reviews the tests, and then runs them all for each version of the product.
The team is composed of full-time staff, and everyone knows exactly what is expected of them.

In practice few organisations have that luxury.
There is not time to run all the tests on every product version - especially on fix-releases
that need to be rolled out quickly. 
Requirements are constantly changing, and the tests have to be changed in step.
Test staff come and go.
There are misunderstandings over who was supposed to run which tests, so some get missed.
Management suddenly wants a status update at seven in the evening.

In these situations you need the support of a test management tool, such as TestLink.
The purpose of TestLink is to answer questions such as:

- For which requirements do we still need to write or update test cases?
- Which tests do you want me to run for this version?
- How much progress have we made on testing this release?
- Which test cases are currently failing, and what are the errors?
- On which version was this group of test cases last run, and is it time we ran them again?
- And ultimately: is this version of the product fit for release?

TestLink helps you to keep the test process under control.
It forms a repository for requirements and test cases, and relates these to builds,
platforms and staff. 
You allocate tests to staff who carry them out and record the results.
A wide variety of reports provide information on what has been done and what still needs to be done.


2. Release notes / Critic Configuration Notes
===============================================================

This release contains bugfixes for 1.9.8
See CHANGELOG file for detailed list of issues fixed.

*** CRITIC PHP.INI Settings ***
max_input_vars, Available since PHP 5.3.9. Default value:1000
If you are going to have test plans with more that 100 test cases, it will be CRITIC 
to increase this value in order to avoid issues (CRASH or MALFUNCTIONS) when adding
test cases to test plan.
See:
http://www.teamst.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=7124&p=17284&sid=e3552aca223ac1f6b3676812aa02f04c#p17284

3. System Requirements - server
===============================================================

Server environment should consists from:
- web-server: Apache 2.x
- PHP > 5.4
- DBMS: MySQL 5.x , Postgres 8.x,9.x , MS-SQL 2005/2008

Supported client web-browsers: 
- Firefox 10 - 23
- Internet Explorer 9.x
- Chrome   



4. Installation & SECURITY
===============================================================
The following details the basic steps for installation on any system. 
Instructions may seem unix-centric but should work on Windows systems.

Barring complications, it should take you about 10-20 minutes 
to install, configure, and be using TestLink.

Short summary:
 1. Transfer files
 2. Uncompress files
 3. Launch web based installer

1. First, transfer the file to your web-server using whatever 
method you like best (ftp, scp, etc).  
You will need to telnet/ssh into the server machine for the next steps.

2. Next, untar/gunzip it to the directory that you want.
The usual command is (1 step):

	tar zxvf <filename.tar.gz>

OR  (2 steps):

	gunzip <filename.tar.gz>
	tar xvf <filename.tar>

Total Commander, Winzip, and other programs should also be able 
to handle decompression of the archive.

At this point you may want to rename the directory to something 
different to 'testlink'. 

*** SECURITY ****
You need to configure:

- log directory 	($tlCfg->log_path)
- upload directory  ($g_repositoryPath)

according to your installation, default values provided are examples THAT DOES NOT WORK OUT OF THE BOX

Give a look to:

http://mantis.testlink.org/view.php?id=4977
http://mantis.testlink.org/view.php?id=4906

You should also need to configure write access for logging, upload and template directories.

*** FCKEDITOR UPLOAD ****

3. Launch web based installer
We will create the necessary database tables and a basic configuration
file. From your web server, access http://yoursite/testlink/ 
or similar URL and follow instructions.

Check Installation manual and TestLink forum if you meet a problem.


5. Upgrade and Migration

When accessing Installer page you will found ONLY NEW INSTALLATION OPTION
Migration HAS TO BE DONE MANUALLY => read below 
- Upgrade from 1.9.3  to 1.9.4/5/6/7/8
- Upgrade from 1.9.4/5 to 1.9.7
- Upgrade from 1.9.7 to 1.9.8
- Migration from other releases that 1.9.3

 Steps
 - Make a Backup of your current database.
 - Using  a NEW DIRECTORY (DO NOT OVERWRITE your old installation),  
   do only following steps from Install procedure:
                                           Transfer files
                                           Uncompress files
 - Copy your old config_db.inc.php and custom_config.inc.php to NEW DIRECTORY.
 - Launch TestLink
 - TestLink will check Database version, and if some upgrade/migration 
   is needed will launch automatically the installer.

 If you are updating a same major version (for example 1.7.0 to 1.7.1) 
 you need to use Upgrade Database.
 
 If you are using a different major version detailed in options,  
 you need to use the specific Migrations.
 
 If in some steps TestLink ask you for two databases, 
 NEVER use same name from both.
 
 If you do not find nothing useful, post in forum
   
 Always before login, after an upgrade/migration clear browser cookies.

Extreme example Migration from 1.7.4

1.7.4 => 1.7.5 => 1.8.1 => 1.8.2 => 1.8.3 => 1.8.4 => 1.8.5 => 1.9.0
